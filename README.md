* Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
* Load the activity and feature info
* Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
* Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
* Merges the two datasets
* Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
* Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
